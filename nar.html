            <p>
            	TechOps needs a single source of truth for automation activities in order to demonstrate productivity gains to leadership.
            </p>
            <h4 style="font-weight: lighter; letter-spacing: 0.3px;">PERSONAS</h4>
            <p>
                I defined personas through conversations with them. Since I was a designer embedded in the team, and the tool was internal, I had easy access to actual users throughout the process.

            <h4 style="font-weight: lighter; letter-spacing: 0.3px;">SCENARIOS</h4>
            	<p>Mike is a TechOps leader who cares about his teams. He wants to understand and assess his teams' tools and know their proven value, so he can make data-driven decisions on tech & business strategy.</p>
           		<p>Taylor is a TechOps developer who cares about efficiency. She wants to spend her time developing meaningful products and understandnig how her work maps to the bigger picture, so she can know her work is valued.</p>
  			<h4 style="font-weight: lighter; letter-spacing: 0.3px;">PROTOTYPE</h4>
  				<p>Among other things, from a visual standpoint, it was important to me to make use of the NCSS standards in this prototype. NCSS is a shared component/CSS library that enables consistency across Nike's many digital products.</p>
  			<h4 style="font-weight: lighter; letter-spacing: 0.3px;">OUTCOMES</h4>
  				<p>Nike Automation Registry is live in production today and many teams are onboarded. I paired closely with the development team to deliver this product. I wished that I had more time to spend working on the data model itself: I believe the amount of information required and the structuring of tools & actions as such could be streamlined, but the timeline required us to move ahead in stage 1. In the future, I would recommend sourcing information from users to refine and restructure the data to ensure it is the simplest solution.</p>
