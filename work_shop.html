				<h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
				<p><strong>Problem: </strong>I love eating fresh vegetables and cooking for myself, but I do not own a car or have reliable access to one on campus. I tried using Uber and Lyft to get to the grocery store, but that got expensive really quickly. I also tried hitching a ride from friends who had cars, but our schedules never lined up. This problem is not unique to me; many students at the University of Michigan struggle to find quality groceries and get to a grocery store in an affordable, convenient way. University students want a way to get to the grocery store affordably and conveniently, even if they do not personally own a car, because grocery options on campus are extremely limited and overpriced. Additionally, students who do own cars and grocery shop off-campus want to benefit by making a little bit of extra cash on what would be just an average shopping trip.</p></br>
				<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
				<ul><li>I approached this problem first by confirming if the problem I noticed was felt by other students. In casual conversations with several students, I confirmed that it was a ubiquitous problem.</li><li>Then, I iterated through a couple of ideas. Did I want this to be an app that schedules rides? How much autonomy did I want riders and drivers to have? How did I prevent this app from becoming Uber or Lyft? Did I want to connect users to Facebook? How would I handle payment from users?</li><li> These questions pervaded my initial design process, which began by wireframing very simplistic ideas in black and white. I tested these wireframes by having University students offer feedback. From these processes, some structural wireframes emerged and I experimented with several different visual design treatments. I then user tested the different low-fidelity visual designs, and found where confusing iconography or unfamiliar user patterns emerged. </li><li>Going forward, I simplified and refined some of the colors, icons, and input/button styles to create more unity throughout the design. I wanted to make sure each screen felt and looked connected throughout the product. My guiding design principles were unity, user-tested designs, and clarity, and discovering these principles through this product design experience has helped me learn to apply them to other designs in my work. </li>
				</ul></br>
				<p><strong>Artifacts from the process:</strong></p>
				<ul><li>Inspirations: <a href="https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/1341307/screenshots/3375373/walkthrough-flat-circle.gif">onboarding</a>, <a href="https://webgradients.com/?ref=sidebar">gradients</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://invis.io/YQB27QAET">Earlier prototype iteration</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong><a href="https://invis.io/W5BBBQOCT">Prototype</a></strong></p> 
				<p><strong>Reflection on my solution:</strong> I think that my solution has a very clear golden path for users to follow. I think it begins with an elegant and inviting onboarding process. One thing I find important is minimizing the number of clicks a user needs to go through in order to complete a task. For example, in selecting the grocery store a user is going to, I wanted to make sure that multiple screens weren’t used. In addition, I think that supporting messaging features in order to implement the details of a trip was a smarter design choice than trying to include menu and dropdown features. It allows for users to really customize their experience of their trip as well as the app. Furthermore, I think that my use of a progress bar allows users to gauge how they are doing in completing the process of signing up for a ride, which is helpful for usability. Additionally, the sign up and payment processes are both only one simple screen each, which makes transaction costs low for retaining and adding users.</p></br>
				<p><strong>Reactions to my solution:</strong> In hindsight, I think pushing my experimentation with colors could have helped this design be more usable. There were some critiques that it was difficult to differentiate between subtle colors, and rethinking contrast could have helped in this area. The onboarding was quite usable, but there were a few buttons throughout that maybe would have only worked for users with smaller hands such as myself, but were not selectable for the majority of users with different hand sizes. In these cases, it is important to do more final high-fidelity user testing so I could have refined the sizing and improved experience for all users. There was positive feedback as well on the loading process and I think incorporating more of these delightful moments and creative, distinctive ways to display feedback to users, particularly in the progress bar I incorporated, could have been helpful.</p></br>
				<p><strong>Next steps: </strong>My immediate next steps would be to rework the colors to incorporate more of the gradients. In addition, I would increase the contrast for better usability. I would run another set of user tests to ensure the click-ability and positioning of all my elements. I would ideally like to incorporate the use of animation, and further explore animation tools such as Principle. I also think finding ways for users to join in rides of others that are already established would also be a cool feature to incorporate. Overall, I think the main thing I need is to develop more confidence in my decisions as a designer. I struggle a lot with second guessing patterns I’m using and color choices I’ve made. While I’m usually fairly confident in my underlying ideas, I think practicing confidence in my choices is one of my main goals going forward in learning product design.</p>
