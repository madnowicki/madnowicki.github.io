	<h6>Problem Statement & Audience: </h6>
	<p class="port-cont">I love eating fresh vegetables and cooking for myself, but I do not own a car or have reliable access to one on campus. I tried using Uber and Lyft to get to the grocery store, but that got expensive really quickly. I also tried hitching a ride from friends who had cars, but our schedules never lined up. This problem is not unique to me; many students at the University of Michigan struggle to find quality groceries and get to a grocery store in an affordable, convenient way. University students want a way to get to the grocery store affordably and conveniently, even if they do not personally own a car, because grocery options on campus are extremely limited and overpriced. Additionally, students who do own cars and grocery shop off-campus want to benefit by making a little bit of extra cash on what would be just an average shopping trip.</p>

	<h6>Creative Process: </h6>
	<p class="port-cont">I approached this problem first by confirming if the problem I noticed was felt by other students. In casual conversations with several students, I confirmed that it was a ubiquitous problem. Then, I iterated through a couple of ideas. Did I want this to be an app that schedules rides? How much autonomy did I want riders and drivers to have? How did I prevent this app from becoming Uber or Lyft? Did I want to connect users to Facebook? How would I handle payment from users? These questions pervaded my initial design process, which began by wireframing very simplistic ideas in black and white. I tested these wireframes by having University students offer feedback.
