				<h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
				<p>Problem: Over $1.4 million was being lost annually due to errors in the way Nike’s supply chain data flows were tracked. Specifically, customers were not being invoiced 100% of the time, and inventory in warehouses was not being decremented following sales. No proactive way to mitigate these errors in data management existed and miscommunication throughout the process was rampant.</p></br>
				<p>Process:</p>
				<ul><li>Initially began researching the Nike supply chain and data stewardship ecosystems through interviews with stakeholders from engineering, business, and project management teams. Gained understanding of top-priority needs and synthesized feature set through iterative interviews.</li>
					<li>Researched existing enterprise data management tools used by Nike, Inc. to assess the best option for this project’s scope. Then, taught myself new programming conventions in order to integrate my technical skills into the project’s requirements.</li>
					<li>Iteratively tested progress on dashboard with user interviews and one-on-one usability studies with stakeholders. Coded new features as necessary and designed layout for maximum salience and productivity.</li>
				</ul></br>
				<p>Results: Unfortunately I am unable to share artifacts from this project as they are property of Nike, Inc. I will describe the final result, however.</br></br>The final product took the form of a real-time dashboard that was customizable to every Nike warehouse built in Splunk. Along the top, I included key status updates: the number of failed data flows, the number of successful data flows, and the number of pending data flows. Then, I included visualizations regarding the backlog and throughput of data flows and data speed and efficiency. Furthermore, I enabled searching by a particular data point. Any data flow which was delayed (meaning it had been pending for longer than a configurable duration of time) was further classified by severity of problem, and email alerts to specified people of contact as well as ServiceNow tickets were created if severity was high.</br></br> The dashboard’s final state was on a monitor in a collaborative team space between warehouse management and supply chain technology cross-functional teams. It updated in real time for users to identify the overall health of the data flows. Additionally, this dashboard was built in such a way that would allow other teams to adopt it as a template so that they could implement proactive monitoring for their team’s data. </br></br>

This project was selected as one of the top four internship projects out of Nike, Inc. in summer 2017 based on the criteria of usability, practicality, and business impact. I presented this project to all senior directors of supply chain, vice presidents of technology, the CIO, and the COO of Nike. </p></br></br>
				<h4>IN ADDITION...</h4>
				<p>As a stretch project during this internship, I lead a team of 13 interns towards creating a solution to increase the proportion of women in coaching at the volunteer level. As a portion of the solution, I developed wireframes and a low fidelity prototype for a mobile application to support new coaches, keep them engaged, and educate them. You may <a href="https://invis.io/VDDZ71R5J">view this prototype in InVision.</a></p>
			</br>
			<p>I also lead the UX research for the intern hackathon project which was development of a release management scheduling tool. <a href="/img/lofi_nike.pdf">Samples of the low-fidelity wireframes that guided our development process are viewable as pdfs.</a></p>
