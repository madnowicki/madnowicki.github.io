            <h4>Let's Start at the Beginning</h4>
            <p>This project started back in 2016 when our team of two designers and four developers pitched our plans of designing and creating an app to The Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell's student-run newspaper.</p>

            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>Print media was becoming less popular, as the Daily Sun was recently forced to reduce their number of printed editions from 5 to 3 days a week. This was a problem because it decreased opportunities for advertisement revenue and the ability for readers both on and off campus to consume the Daily Sun’s content.</p>

            <h5>Opportunity</h5>
            <p>We thought that developing an app was a promising opportunity to expand the Daily Sun’s content distribution and advertisement revenue at a cheaper cost. Additionally, we wanted to provide a new platform for Daily Sun content, like podcasts, photos and videos, that aren’t interacted with as much as the written content.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row" style="margin-top: 45px;">
        <div class="offset-by-one nine columns">
            <h4>Focus</h4>
            <p>As one of two designers on the team, I was put in charge of designing the content consumption experience and extendingx the Daily Sun web design system to a mobile friendly experience.</p>
            <p>Specifically, we wanted to explore ways to seamlessly transfer the Daily Sun content, like articles, videos, and photos, to a mobile experience while maintaining the visual brand that they’ve established on their website.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row" style="margin-top: 45px;">
        <div class="offset-by-one nine columns">
            <h4>First Brainstorm</h4>
            <p>To begin, our team organized a brainstorm with the Daily Sun Editors, Business Managers and writers to brainstorm and sync on a plan for the app.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/FirstMeeting.jpeg" alt="DSImage">
            <p>Before talking to Daily Sun readers, we wanted to sync on a general vision for the app so we would know what to test and research. We combined our respective design, development and business strategy perspectives to decide on areas to explore that reflected both our goals and the goals of the Daily Sun.</p>
            <p>The five areas that we chose to explore with our readers were Notifications, Feeds, Saving, Multimedia and Social.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/AppVisionGraphic.jpg" alt="DSImage">
            <p>These cards reflected the key experience areas that we wanted to explore and potentially enhance with a mobile app. For example, we wanted to test how the various Daily Sun Content from Articles to Multimedia could be experienced on a mobile app in different Feeds.</p>
            <p>With this honed vision, I moved forward to the research stage with two goals. First, I needed to explore students preferences with these content consumption areas. Second, I needed to do this while extending the visual system and branding that the Daily Sun had already established on their website.</p>

            <h4>Inspiration</h4>
            <p>Before I interviewed students, I audited other popular apps. While I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, I wanted to take inspiration from these standards to design a unique product and experience for our users.</p>

            <h5>Content Interaction</h5>
            <p>For content interaction standards, I explored how Twitter, Instagram and Facebook organize information to create interaction opportunities for their users.</p>
            <p>I was curious as to how common actions like Liking, Sharing and Commenting could be applied to the content of a college newspaper.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/SocialMedia.jpg" alt="DSImage">

            <h5>Cross Platform Visual Language</h5>
            <p>I studied BuzzfeedNews, The Washington Post and The New York Times to see how how their use of typography and content layout created a coherent brand language across their web and mobile platforms.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/NewsApps.jpg" alt="DSImage">

            <h5>Findings</h5>
            <p>The designers and Daily Sun staff aligned on a direction that took elements from all of these apps. We wanted the app to reflect our visual branding prestige, like the NYT and WaPo, while providing the simple experience of BuzzfeedNews and interaction opportunities of social media.</p>

        <div class="offset-by-one nine columns">
            <h4>Part 1: Interaction Testing</h4>
            <p>To start my testing process, I used standards that I found in the previously mentioned social media and news app to design medium-fidelity content cells for Articles, Podcasts, Videos and Image Galleries.</p>

            <h5>Medium Fidelity Designs</h5>
            <p>I designed medium-fidelity content cells to test different combinations of interaction actions with written articles, videos and photo galleries. These action groups were inspired by the previously mentioned social media apps.</p>
            <p>My intention behind this was to explore if college-aged kids would interact with more local content from their student newspaper the same way that they would interact with popular content on social media.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/TestingCells_2.jpg" alt="DSImage">
            <p>I also organized these cells into single or multiple feeds based on written and multimedia content. This was done to address our initial goal of bringing the Daily Sun multimedia content to more prominence.</p>

            <h5>Prototyping and Testing</h5>
            <p>I created Framer prototypes and conducted some guerrilla user testing with Cornell students to learn about user preferences.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/TestingPrototype.gif" alt="DSImage">

            <p>Here’s what I learned.</p>
            <h5>Insights</h5>
            <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>People did not like the direct similarity to social media cells in terms of action icons placement. They felt that it didn’t match the Daily Sun brand and purpose, or that we were trying to be something that we were not.</li>
                <li>Most people felt they would share articles but were confused about the purpose of a like button since there were no user profiles. Also, most felt they wouldn't publically comment like they do in social media.</li>
                <li>Most preferred one feed with all the content of articles, videos and image galleries in one place. They felt they would be less likely to explore an extra tab if it was split.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Direction</h5>
            <p>I decided to only use the bookmark and share icon as these were the two actions that received the most positive feedback on potential interaction. There may be room to increase interactivity with likes and comments in the future, but for version one, I stuck to user preferences.</p>
            <p>I also decided to include all the content on one feed, as according to user insight, this was the best way to increase visibility of all content.</p>
            <p>I combined these user insights and the previously mentioned industry design standards to continue to iterate on designs and ask for feedback from the Daily Sun staff and Cornell students.</p>

        <div class="offset-by-one nine columns">
            <h4>Part 2: Cross Platform Visual Language</h4>
            <p>Once I had the basic designs, I took a deep dive into the visual design.</p>

            <h5>Matching Current Style Guide</h5>
            <p>Previously, I had collaborated with the Daily Sun Design Department to make a list of fonts and colors that are used on the website. I adapted the fonts to reflect both mobile standards and the Daily Sun visual brand.</p>
            <p>The only change that was made was making the San Serif typeface San Francisco Pro, as we were developing an iOS app and the Daily Sun Design Department expressed intent to make this change on web anyway.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/StyleGuide_2.png" alt="DSImage">
            <p>I applied these visual design changes to the latest mockups from my testing process, updating their typography and colors. The updated feed cells can be seen below.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/OriginalDesigns.jpg" alt="DSImage">

            <h5>Spacing</h5>
            <p>After the typography and colors were applied, I took my current designs to my co-designer, our developers and other designers for more visual design feedback. What I learned was that the spacing of information components could be improved, as it was difficult to differentiate them and infer hierarchy with the medium fidelity spacing.</p>
            <p>Starting with the Leading Article Cell, I implemented a 4px Grid and re-spaced the content accordingly. As you can see below, the spacing provides more distinction between the different information components, like the article title, byline and description.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/Spacing.jpg" alt="DSImage">

            <h5>Exploring Font Differentiation</h5>
            <p>However, there was still a problem with differentiating the information elements, as the metadata SF fonts (Byline and Timestamp) blended with the regular weighted Georgia font used in the description.</p>
            <p>To address this, I explored ways to differentiate the metadata and description through changing font weights and colors and by experimenting with placement.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/MetadataExploration.jpg" alt="DSImage">
            <p>In the first option, making the metadata font weights heavier gave them too much emphasis over the description, thus creating an innaccurate information hierarchy.</p>
            <p>While combining the metadata into one line differentiated it, it either left an awkward white space in the bottom left or diminished the hierarchy of the byline over the timestamp. One of the main draws to articles, according to my research with Cornell students, was seeing a friend’s name, so I wanted to keep the name separate from the timestamp.</p>
            <p>I ended up choosing the "Grey Metadata/All Caps Byline", as seen with the red highlight. Changing the color to a lighter gray and capitalizing the byline best differentiated the metadata from the description while maintaining the hierarchy of the byline over the timestamp.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/FinalLeadingDesign.jpg" alt="DSImage">
            <p>I applied these visual design changes to the other feed content cells, which can be seen below.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/FeedCells.jpg" alt="DSImage">

    <div class="row" style="margin-top: 45px;">
        <div class="offset-by-one nine columns">
            <h4>Article Design</h4>
            <p>While the video/audio and photo gallery cells could all be experiences in the feed, the articles needed to map to a different page to show the actual content of the article.</p>
            <p>The article design was based off of several existing news app standards and the information requirements of the Daily Sun Website.</p>
            <img src="images/DailySunCS/Article.jpg" alt="DSImage">
            <p>Articles are not just text, but are made up of different componenets like block quotes, images and suggested stories. I designed these elements as well.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row" style="margin-top: 45px;">
        <div class="offset-by-one nine columns">
            <h4>Visual Elements</h4>
            <p>While a lot of the design used the existing Daily Sun visual language as a foundation, some elements needed in mobile did not exist in the web design. For example, navigation icons had not yet been designed.</p>

            <p>I was tasked with designing the interaction and navigation icons from scratch. I wanted them to match the design language that I had been working with while applying an original style.</p>

            <h5>Icons</h5>
            <p>I found inspiration in the same apps I used before, especially the news apps. However, I found their icons to be mostly heavily weighted, which gave them an outdated, clunky look.</p>
            <p>I wanted a light and modern feel for the Daily Sun App, as we were trying to balance the sophistication of the paper with the modern interaction of a social media app. Consequently, I based all of the icons in a 3px line weight. Upon selection, the icon weight would bump up to 4px and turn red.</p>
            <p>This was the result of countless iterations.</p>

            <h4>Shipped! 🚀</h4>
            <p>I am happy to say that after countless hours of hard work our team has shipping the The Cornell Daily Sun News App. It can be found <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cornell-daily-sun/id1375063933?mt=8" target="blank_">here</a> on the App Store!</p>

            <p>I want to thank my co-designer Alexis Vinzons, as our processes were often intertwined, and our awesome development team for making this possible. We look forward to continue working on the app and adding more features in the future!</p>
