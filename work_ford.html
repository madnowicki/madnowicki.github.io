				<h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
				<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Communication between the Ford Smart Mobility Research team and all other IT teams was extremely limited, causing confusion and company culture concerns for the Smart Mobility Research team. In addition, the onboarding process for the team was outdated and not user friendly.</p></br>
				<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
				<ul><li>I conducted extensive interviews to understand what users internal to my department as well as external currently understood about the department’s efforts. I also researched widely the best platforms to reach people, using surveys and interviews to understand options with the best reach. </li><li>I then presented multiple design solutions for emails to my managers, iterated over several approaches, tested the final few campaigns on team members,and eventually wrote all the content as well as developed the final product independently. I taught myself best practices for email marketing and email specific design, and developed the actual deliverables.</li><li>In addition, I conducted interviews with new team members as well as new clients to understand their frustrations and pain points with the onboarding systems for my department. I built a new information architecture for materials previously stored on slide decks and in binders, creating interactive SharePoint sites to host this content. </li><li>Furthermore, I found in interviews that the materials were boring and hard to digest, so I designed a set of infographics using Adobe Creative Suite to engage people in the onboarding process.</li></ul></br>
				<p><strong>Results: </strong>During the email campaign, I tracked the metrics for how many people received the email, opened it, and visited the links embedded to track engagement, and was able to increase subscriptions by 300% and drive unique visits to my department’s website by 140% throughout my 12-week internship.</br></br>I also tested the onboarding materials by observing users, seeing that instead of clicking through material too quickly or staying on sections for too long, people engaged with the content in much more manageable amounts of time. In exit surveys, users reported an average of 51% higher satisfaction as compared to prior onboarding experiences.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Unfortunately the work I did for Ford was proprietary and I am unable to release images or artifacts from this process. Feel free to reach out to me with questions you may have regarding this project!</p>
