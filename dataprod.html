                This project started initially in service to improving the experience of a new data-movement platform. Nearly immediately, we realized that we could upgrade certain elements of that product's UX, but overall, we needed to dig into the overall issues that data scientists and engineers were having.

            	<p>
            		I was responsible for recruiting participants, writing interview and workshop questions, facilitating and notetaking, and creating the journey map.

            <h4 style="font-weight: lighter; letter-spacing: 0.3px;">PERSONAS</h4>
            	<p>   
            		The users of data products at Nike span a large range of teams. While the goals, technical needs, and maturity levels of these teams differ, the job titles of data scientist, data engineer, and engineering manager were all relevant to the data product ecosystem.<br/><br/>
            		We began by recruiting data scientists and engineers for one-on-one interviews.
